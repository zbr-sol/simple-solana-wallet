# Wallet Tutorial
This is an extremely simple implementation of a wallet for the [Solana](https://solana.com/) protocol. Figment (more details below) provided a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application that I completed by leveraging Solana's [JavaScript SDK](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/index.html).

If you follow my commit history, you can see that we built this wallet in a few discrete steps:
1. Create the wallet by generating a mnemonic device and converting it to seed bytes. We can then create a new "account" using this seed.  
2. Be able to fetch the SOL balance from this wallet address
3. Request an airdrop of 1 SOL to this address from a devnet "faucet"
4. Be able to send/transfer funds to any other wallet address
5. Log out and "recover" an account by importing the seed/recovery phrase generated in step 1
